# Text mining app with LSA, LDA and pubmed query on the PubMed abstracts database

## How to run the app

- Make sure you have R installed  
- The first line of the Source/main.R and the GUI/app.R is to set the working directory (path to Text_mining_project must be set)  
- TIP: to get the path to the current working directory, type getwd() in the console
- The packages are installed automaticly  
- Choose the parameters you want in the Source/main.R  
- Check if you have the database.xml in the Data directory  
- Run main.R (it should fill the Data dir with some cool files)
- Run app.R and start querying  

The ShinyApps can be hosted on a server so the final user can access it without having R installed
